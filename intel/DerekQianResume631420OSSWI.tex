Derek is seeking a system software internship beginning after March 20, 2013. With the knowlege of computer architecture and operating system internal and the work experience on the porting of Embedded Operating System, including bootloader, kernel and device drivers, he wants to gain more experience on OS software enhancement technique. He is interested in operating systems and virtualization software. After getting his Master's Degree in Electrical and electronics Engineering and over 5 years' hand-on experience on computer hardware and software, Derek felt it necessary to solidate his software skill, this is why he is pursuing his Master's Degree in Computer Science at Portland State University now. This intern job is the one he is preparing for and hunting for.

He is a perfect candidate on this job. He has a solid knowledge. His interest focus on system software development. He has worked in mobile computation area for over 5 years, developing PDA (Portable Digital Assistant), PND (Portable Navigation Device), PMC (Portable Media Center) and Smartphone. He has a good understanding of general PC architecture and master the knowledge of embedded development, hardware interaction (register and MMIO), and prototype platform development environments. He is proficient in C/C++ and object oriented programming and knows system-level debugging very well.

During his past work, he experienced software development process and agile SW product development methodology. He knows protocols like USB, TCP/IP, I2C, SPI, RS232, and experienced driver port and development for devices like NOR/NAND FLASH, LCD, TOUCH SCREEN, USB, UART, AUDIO, KEYPAD, SD/MMC/SDIO for Windows/Linux system as well as bootloader and kernel development. He can read schematics and PCB diagrams. He is a good team player and can work in a small team, however, he also has ability to operate independently.
