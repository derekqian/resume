    I was born and raised in Copenhagen where I have liv\-ed all my life except
    6 months in which I studied on the Arctic island Svalbard and currently I
    am living together with my girlfriend Pernille Petersen (claissical flute
    player).  I have always been very interested in computers and science and
    by studying physics I had the possibility to combine these two subjects. 

    Currently I work at Schlumberger as a geophysicist and Linux system
    administator, which is a quite ideal combination in my opinion. A typical
    day of work could either be spent doing wavelet extraction on seismic data
    or writing a munin plugin to various services on the servers. 
    
    When I am not doing physics or computers I  enjoy sports. I play badminton
    once a week and fitness twice a week. Beside sports my hobbies are
    photography and traveling.

    \section{\mysidestyle Education} \textbf{Masters degree in geophysics from
    the University of Copenhagen} (2006-2008). Thesis advisors: Klaus Mosegaard
    (KU) and Trine Dahl Jensen (GEUS).  Thesis title: \textit{Receiver function
    modeling}. Modeling local subsurface velocity structures using multiple
    diverse algorithms.

    \textbf{Bachelor degree in physics from the University of Copenhagen}
    (2001-2006).  Thesis advisor: Tomas Bohr (DTU Physics).
    Thesis title: Symmetry breaking in the free surface of rotating fluids
    with high Reynolds numbers.  Enrolled: September 2001

    \textbf{Rysensteens Gymnasium} (1998-2001) High school.  I attended a
    special mathematical/physical line. Located in Copenhagen.

    \textbf{Den Classenske Legatskole} (1989-1998) Municipal School.
