%General Resume Tips
%   No periods!  Technically, nothing in this document is a full sentence.
%   Use parallelism by ending key words with the same thing,  i.e. "Coordinated; Designed; Communicated".

		\item[Pedigree Chart] {\footnotesize Developed a program which will parse through a pedigree file and display a pedigree chart in the command line}
		\item[Factory Nail Rejection] {\footnotesize This program was simulating a factory which produced nails that had to be a very specific length, and if it wasn't, the program would reject it}
		\item[Calendar Program] {\footnotesize Given the time and date to display, the calendar program would display a simple calendar on the command line which took into account leap years}
		\item[Normal Distribution] {\footnotesize This program simulated the classic wheel of fortune blinko game where several thousand chip were statistially recorded and displayed as they dropped into a board filled with pegs}
		\item[RSA Encryption] {\footnotesize Developed an application which utilized the RSA encryption method to encrypt and decrypt messages}
